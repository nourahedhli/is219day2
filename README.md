## Homework: Explain Object Oriented Programming Using JavaScript

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation means that there many methods or objects inside a class. Like here for Example we class addition that has many methods inside of it and class addition encapsulate these objects. In order to use those methods, we have to call/import those classes to use the methods.

Example of Encapsulation ^^^

### Abstraction

Abstraction is basically like hiding the manual from the "user". Like for example, if we are using a computer we are only pressing buttons, but we have no idea what is going on, on the inside. So Abstraction is basically calling a class to do something but we do not know how it is doing it. Like in the example of the Calculator.py we are calling Addition to do sum by giving it parameters. Lets say I was not the one who created the class Addition, but only know that if I use it, I can do the sum of these two numbers.

### Inheritance

Inheritance in any Object Ordinated programming language is like the parent class. Where you get to use this class for multiple other classes. Like for example let say we built a class for a person that has a name, last name and address. We can use this Class Person, in a class called Student, or in another class called Teacher. Therefore, one class can be used or called in many other classes. Like the class Addition can be used in a lot of other classes for example we can used it to sum up a list or use it to find the average of a class.

Here in this example we are using sum to add two numbers.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is when you name two methods with the same name, but they have different parameters. The program will know which one to use depending on the parameters that was given.

This Example of a polymorphism is adding two numbers if B=Null means that its a list and it should use the other sumList method to add all the numbers in that list and return it to the sum method. If not then it will do a normal addition of a and b.
